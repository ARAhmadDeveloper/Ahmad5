## 🚀 What You'll Learn

- **Input & Output**: User input, printing, and formatting
- **Conditionals**: if, elif, else, and logical operators
- **Loops**: for, while, break, continue
- **Data Structures**: Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Sets, Arrays
- **String Manipulation**: Slicing, joining, reversing, and more
- **List Comprehensions**: Elegant, Pythonic data processing
- **Functions**: Arguments, \*args, \*\*kwargs, lambda, generators
- **Object-Oriented Programming**:
  - Classes & Objects
  - Inheritance & Multiple Inheritance
  - Encapsulation & Polymorphism
  - Class & Static Methods
  - Property Decorators
- **Advanced Python**:

## 📂 Project Structure

- `app.py`  
  A treasure trove of Python code snippets, each focusing on a specific concept. Most code is commented—uncomment the section you want to experiment with!
- `app2.py`  
  A minimal example showing how to import and use functions from `app.py`.

---

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. **Clone this repository**
2. Open `app.py` in your favorite editor
3. Uncomment any code block you want to run or learn about
4. Run the file using:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
5. Explore, modify, and experiment to deepen your understanding!
